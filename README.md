# Tech Company Workload Seasonality
Analysis for a tech company partnered with Northeastern University during the spring quarter of 2025. The data was anonomyzed, and I have provided a sample of the first 100 rows in the data section of this project, but it will unfortunately not be reproducable. This tech company requested that we analyze their billing data and report any interesting patterns and occurences we can. 

## Motivation / Purpose
The client listed a few things they wanted from us, including predictions, trends and revenue statistics. I chose to focus on the identification of seasonal patterns related to their workload and specific clients or groups of clients.

## Data
One excel file including the columns:
**Customer Name**: Name of customer where they performed the work
**Project**: Name of project.
**Worked Date**: Date of time of entry for the work.
**Task or Ticket Title**: Title of task or ticket.
**Resource Name**: Person on their team who delivered the project.
**Billable Hours**: Number of hours worked for the customer. 
**Billing Rate**: Rate for consultant on that role on that project
**Extended Price**: Number of hours multiplied by rate.
