# tech_company_workload_seasonality
Analysis for a tech company partnered with Northeastern University during the spring quarter of 2025. The data was anonomyzed, and I have provided a sample of the first 100 rows in the data section of this project, but it will unfortunately not be reproducable. This tech company requested that we analyze their billing data and report any interesting patterns and occurences we can. 

## Motivation / Purpose
